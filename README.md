This is the README for the frontend of our monster mash project.

the frontend is responsible for the giving the web application 

        -- A HTML Page
        -- CSS
        -- Js functionality

The front end will also need to be able to accesse the backend with Full CRUD.

Our Modles (Monsters, and Parts) will each have full CRUD (part does't have Update).

A part belongs to a monster (with this modle the monster is the user?)
